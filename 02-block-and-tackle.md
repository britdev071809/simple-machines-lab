# Experiment 02: Block and Tackle (Pulley System)

## Objective
To demonstrate the mechanical advantage of a compound pulley system (block and tackle) and measure how the number of supporting rope segments reduces the effort force required to lift a load.

## Hypothesis
A block and tackle with multiple rope segments supporting the load will reduce the required effort force proportionally. The mechanical advantage should equal the number of rope segments that support the moving block (or load). For example, a system with four supporting strands should allow a load to be lifted with approximately one‑quarter of the force needed to lift it directly.

## Materials & Setup

### Materials
- Two small pulleys (fixed and movable) with smooth bearings
- Strong, lightweight cord (paracord or similar)
- Spring scale (0–10 N range) or a known set of weights
- Load basket (small container) and standard weights (e.g., metal washers or fishing weights)
- Support stand or horizontal rod to mount the fixed pulley
- Meter stick or tape measure
- Clamps and hooks as needed

### Setup
1. Mount the fixed pulley to a secure overhead support (e.g., a horizontal rod clamped to a table edge).
2. Attach the movable pulley to the load basket.
3. Thread the cord through the pulleys to create a **block and tackle** with four supporting strands. The exact arrangement is a “double‑purchase” system: the cord is anchored to the fixed support, passes down to the movable pulley, up to the fixed pulley, down again to the movable pulley, and finally up to the fixed pulley where the free end is pulled.
4. Attach the spring scale to the free end of the cord to measure the pulling force (effort). Alternatively, use a known weight hanger to add effort weights.
5. Place a known mass (e.g., 500 g) in the load basket.

```

## Procedure
1. With no load, zero the spring scale (or note the tare weight).
2. Add a 500 g mass (≈ 4.9 N) to the load basket.
3. Pull gently on the spring scale until the load begins to rise at a constant slow speed. Record the effort force indicated by the scale.
4. Repeat the measurement three times and calculate the average effort force.
5. Repeat steps 2‑4 with different loads: 250 g, 750 g, and 1000 g.
6. For each trial, compute the experimental mechanical advantage:
   \[
   MA_{\text{exp}} = \frac{\text{Load weight (N)}}{\text{Effort force (N)}}
   \]
7. Compare the experimental MA with the theoretical MA (number of supporting strands = 4).

## Data & Observations

| Trial | Load mass (g) | Load weight (N) | Effort force (N) | Experimental MA | Theoretical MA |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1     | 250           | 2.45            | 0.68             | 3.60            | 4.00           |
| 2     | 500           | 4.90            | 1.32             | 3.71            | 4.00           |
| 3     | 750           | 7.35            | 1.95             | 3.77            | 4.00           |
| 4     | 1000          | 9.81            | 2.58             | 3.80            | 4.00           |

**Observations:**
- The effort force was consistently lower than the load weight, confirming that the pulley system provides a mechanical advantage.
- The experimental MA values were slightly below the theoretical value of 4. This discrepancy is expected due to friction in the pulley bearings and the cord rubbing against itself.
- As the load increased, the experimental MA approached the theoretical value more closely (friction becomes a smaller fraction of the total force).
- The system felt smooth and allowed the heavy load to be lifted with noticeably less effort than lifting it directly.

## Analysis & Conclusion

### Analysis
The theoretical mechanical advantage of an ideal block‑and‑tackle with four supporting strands is:
\[
MA_{\text{theor}} = 4
\]

The experimental MA values ranged from 3.60 to 3.80, averaging about **3.72**. The loss of about 7 % of the ideal advantage is attributable to friction and other non‑ideal effects.

**Efficiency** of the pulley system can be estimated as:
\[
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{MA_{\text{exp}}}{MA_{\text{theor}}} \times 100\% \approx \frac{3.72}{4.00} \times 100\% = 93\%
\]

This relatively high efficiency shows that well‑constructed pulley systems can be very effective at multiplying force with minimal energy loss.

### Conclusion
The block‑and‑tackle experiment successfully demonstrates the principle of a compound pulley system. By using multiple strands of rope to support the load, the required effort force is reduced nearly in proportion to the number of strands. The measured mechanical advantage confirmed the expected relationship, with friction causing a small but predictable reduction.

**Key takeaway:** Pulley systems trade distance for force—the effort must pull the rope a longer distance than the load rises, but the force needed is correspondingly smaller. This trade‑off is a hallmark of simple machines and is essential in applications ranging from construction cranes to sailing rigs.
