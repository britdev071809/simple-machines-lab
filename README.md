# Simple Machines Digital Lab Notebook

## Project Purpose

This repository serves as a structured, version-controlled "digital lab notebook" documenting hands-on experiments with simple machines. The goal is to explore and explain the mechanical principles behind everyday devices through practical demonstrations, using GitHub's collaborative features to organize, refine, and "publish" findings.

## Planned Experiments

The following simple machines will be investigated:

1. **Lever** (First-class, second-class, third-class)
2. **Pulley** (Fixed, movable, block and tackle)
3. **Inclined Plane**
4. **Wheel and Axle**
5. **Wedge**
6. **Screw**

## Workflow

- The `main` branch contains the official, "published" version of the lab notebook.
- Each new experiment is developed on a dedicated feature branch (e.g., `experiment-lever-class-1`).
- Experiment proposals are tracked via GitHub Issues.
- Completed reports are merged into `main` via Pull Requests.
- Milestone releases (tags) mark significant updates to the notebook.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Browse the experiment reports in the root directory (e.g., `01-first-class-lever.md`).
2. View closed issues to see experiment proposals and planning.
3. Examine pull requests to understand the review and integration process.
4. Check releases for curated collections of experiments.

## Getting Started with Your Own Experiments

Feel free to fork this repository and adapt the structure for your own hands‑on investigations. The template encourages a scientific approach: hypothesize, test, document, analyze, and share.
