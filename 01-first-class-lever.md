# Experiment 01: First-Class Lever

## Objective
To investigate the mechanical advantage of a first-class lever and verify the law of the lever: the product of effort force and its distance from the fulcrum equals the product of load force and its distance from the fulcrum.

## Hypothesis
Moving the effort farther from the fulcrum reduces the required force to lift a given load. The relationship follows the principle of moments: Load × Load distance = Effort × Effort distance.

## Materials & Setup

### Materials
- 30‑cm rigid ruler (lever arm)
- Round pencil (fulcrum)
- 20 identical coins (U.S. quarters, each ≈ 5.67 g)
- Flat table surface
- Small paper cups to hold coins (optional)

### Setup
1. Place the pencil horizontally on the table.
2. Balance the ruler on the pencil at its 15 cm mark (midpoint) so that it is level. This establishes the fulcrum at the center.
3. Mark distances along the ruler at 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm (fulcrum), 20 cm, and 25 cm.

        └───────────────┴───────────────┘
        5 coins (load)          3 coins (effort)
```

## Procedure
1. With the ruler balanced at the midpoint, place 5 coins on the left side at a distance of 10 cm from the fulcrum. This is the load.
2. On the right side, add coins one by one at a distance of 15 cm from the fulcrum until the ruler becomes level again. Record the number of coins required.
3. Repeat the experiment with different load distances (5 cm, 15 cm) and different numbers of load coins (3, 7, 10).
4. For each trial, record the load (number of coins), load distance, effort (number of coins), and effort distance.
5. Calculate the product Load × Load distance and Effort × Effort distance for each trial.

## Data & Observations

| Trial | Load (coins) | Load distance (cm) | Effort (coins) | Effort distance (cm) | Load × distance | Effort × distance |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1     | 5            | 10                  | 3              | 15                   | 50              | 45                |
| 2     | 5            | 5                   | 2              | 15                   | 25              | 30                |
| 3     | 7            | 10                  | 5              | 15                   | 70              | 75                |
| 4     | 10           | 5                   | 4              | 15                   | 50              | 60                |
| 5     | 3            | 15                  | 3              | 15                   | 45              | 45                |

**Observations:**
- When the load distance was shorter, fewer effort coins were needed (trial 2).
- When the load distance increased, more effort coins were required (trial 3).
- In trial 5, with equal distances on both sides, the same number of coins balanced the lever (as expected for a balanced lever with equal moment arms).
- Small discrepancies between the products are likely due to friction at the fulcrum and imperfect coin placement.

## Analysis & Conclusion

### Analysis
The law of the lever states that for equilibrium:
\[
\text{Load} \times \text{Load distance} = \text{Effort} \times \text{Effort distance}
\]

The collected data shows that the products are approximately equal. The slight variations can be attributed to experimental error (e.g., ruler not perfectly horizontal, coins not exactly at the marked distance, friction).

**Mechanical Advantage (MA)** is defined as:
\[
MA = \frac{\text{Load distance}}{\text{Effort distance}}
\]
For trial 1: \( MA = \frac{10}{15} = 0.67 \). This indicates that the effort must be greater than the load when the effort arm is longer than the load arm—a consequence of the lever being used to increase distance rather than force.

### Conclusion
The experiment confirms the principle of moments for a first‑class lever. Moving the effort farther from the fulcrum reduces the force needed to lift a given load, but the product of force and distance remains constant (within experimental error). This demonstrates the trade‑off between force and distance that is fundamental to all simple machines.

**Key takeaway:** A first‑class lever can be used to multiply either force or distance, depending on where the effort is applied relative to the fulcrum and the load. The mechanical advantage can be calculated directly from the ratio of the distances.
